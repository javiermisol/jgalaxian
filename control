Description: JGalaxian
 JGalaxian is a Java-based Galaxian clone (you do remember Galaxian, right?). Although it's a pretty fun game in its own right, the code also serves as a decent tutorial on one way of building 2D games in general and in Java in particular. Some features of the design:
 .
     Scalable
     2D sprites
     Sprite lists
     Collision detection
     Game state machine
 .
 Standard stuff, really, but if you're new to 2D game design, maybe you'll find something useful to copy to use in your own games.
